# RadioAstronomySoftware
Code for amateur radio astronomy project.

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of the programs used for the radio telescope and any other code (calculators, visualizers, etc.) that was used
in its design. This is meant to make it easier to program code for different devices, but also so as a demonstration of the programming involved in amateur 
radio astronomy.

The majority of this code is written in Python 3, so with the proper libraries all of this code should be usable on other devices. However, some of the code
uses functionalities unique to specific devices (for instance, the programs for relaying coordinate data to the Raspberry Pi are meant to run on an Android phone
with the Termux environment to use its gyroscopic sensor), and the code was/is/will be written with only the hardware I am using in mind.
